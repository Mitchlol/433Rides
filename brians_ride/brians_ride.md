## Brian's Ride (63.5 Miles+)

We can meet at Marvista Park. [Parking](https://goo.gl/maps/Fipu7G39QX1ySZqe7) is free and the park isnâ€™t usually busy. 

Food and charging before the ferry in Ruston. Unless you have a monster Pro or maybe Sherman charging will be needed. No EV chargers at this location. Depending how many we have that will need charging we may have to pack a lunch and plan a stop at EV chargers instead of restaurants.
